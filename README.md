# kd-Tree-implementation
Implementation of a 2-dimensional kd-Tree data structure in Python.

## Execution
1. Run the `main.py`.
2. Uncomment the test cases and run the file to see the results.

## kd-Tree Methods

- `tree = KDTree()` - creates an instance of a kd-tree from the KDTree class
- `tree.insert((a,b))` - inserts the tuple (a,b), where a and b are real numbers, into the kd-tree
- `tree.visualize()` - prints the kd-tree to show its tree structure
- `tree.delete((a,b))` - deletes the node (a,b), where a and b are real numbers, from the kd-tree
